To create a React application that utilizes the `aws-sfn-graph` library to take user input and render a PNG, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a new React project by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npx create-react-app aws-sfn-graph-demo
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd aws-sfn-graph-demo
```

3. Install the required dependencies by running:
```
npm install aws-sfn-graph
```

4. Create a new file called `GraphRenderer.js` in the `src` directory. This file will contain the code for rendering the PNG using the `aws-sfn-graph` library. Add the following code to the file:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { renderGraph } from 'aws-sfn-graph';

const GraphRenderer = () => {
  const [graphText, setGraphText] = useState('');
  const [pngUrl, setPngUrl] = useState('');

  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    setGraphText(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleRenderClick = () => {
    const pngDataUrl = renderGraph(graphText, 'png');
    setPngUrl(pngDataUrl);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        value={graphText}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        placeholder="Enter the graph definition"
        rows={10}
      />

      <button onClick={handleRenderClick}>Render PNG</button>

      {pngUrl && <img src={pngUrl} alt="Rendered Graph" />}
    </div>
  );
};

export default GraphRenderer;
```

5. Open the `src/App.js` file and replace its content with the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import GraphRenderer from './GraphRenderer';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>AWS SFN Graph Renderer</h1>
      <GraphRenderer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

6. Open the `src/index.js` file and remove the service worker code (if present) to simplify the setup.

7. Start the React development server by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm start
```

8. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action. You will find a textarea where you can enter the graph definition. After entering the definition, click the "Render PNG" button, and the rendered graph PNG will appear below.

Note: This example assumes you have prior knowledge of how to define the graph using the `aws-sfn-graph` library. You need to provide a valid graph definition in the textarea for the rendering to work correctly.

That's it! You have now created a React application that uses the `aws-sfn-graph` library to take user input and render a PNG.
